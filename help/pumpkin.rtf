{ \f1\fs18\b\sb120 About {\b PumpKIN}}
\par\sa120\sb120\qj\pard \f1\fs18\sb120 {\b PumpKIN} is a program designed to send and receive files over the net while having {\uldb {\b T42}}{\v %!ExecFile("http://kin.klever.net/T42/")} or {\b\cf6 Wintalk} session running using {\i TFTP} ({\uldb {\b RFC1350}}{\v %!ExecFile("http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1350.txt")}) protocol. It includes full-functional {\i TFTP} server/client so it may be useful for maintaining {\uldb CISCO}{\v %!ExecFile("http://www.cisco.com/")} routers and other network equipment.

\par\pard\plain\fi0\li0\f1\fs18 \bullet  Sounds customization. Now you can customize {\b PumpKIN} bells and whistles or turn them off completely.
\par\pard\plain\fi0\li0\f1\fs18 \bullet  Previous version of {\b PumpKIN} had a bug causing it to misbehave when you're requesting file from remote {\i tftp} server using {\b IP Address} (as opposed to {\b hostname}).
\par\pard\plain\fi0\li0\f1\fs18 \bullet  Typo causing {\b PumpKIN} to log outgoing request in reverse (i.e. {\i Requesting 'hostname' from 'filename'}) fixed.

\par\pard\plain\fi0\li0\f1\fs18 \bullet  Transfer resumes. No checking on file contents is done, so it's up to you to decide whether you want to start transmission from the beginning or resume unfinished transfer.
\par\pard\plain\fi0\li0\f1\fs18 \bullet  Support for {\b block size}, {\b trasnfer size} and {\b transfer timeout} options as described in {\uldb {\b RFC1782}}{\v %!ExecFile("http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1782.txt")}, {\uldb {\b RFC1783}}{\v %!ExecFile("http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1783.txt")} and {\uldb {\b RFC1784}}{\v %!ExecFile("http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1784.txt")}. I'm not sure if there are any other {\i TFTP} implementations supporting this, but at least it makes sense if you use {\b PumpKIN} on both ends.

${\footnote Using PumpKIN}
{ \f1\fs18\b\sb120 Using {\b PumpKIN}}
\par\sa120\sb120\qj\pard \f1\fs18\sb120 This is a simple program for file exchange between two parties. It allows you to send files over the network to your party while having a {\uldb {\b T42}}{\v %!ExecFile("http://kin.klever.net/T42/")} or {\b\cf6 Wintalk} conversation. It uses open sessions to determine IP address of your party. Also you may use it as a {\i TFTP} client/server by itself. To get/put files from/to {\i TFTP} server you need to enter host name/IP address manually in the {\uldb Request Dialog}{\v Request}.
\par\sa120\sb120\qj\pard \f1\fs18\sb120 To Abort transfer(s) currently in progress - select transfer(s) you want to terminate in the list and click {\b Abort xfer} button.
\par\sa120\sb120\qj\pard \f1\fs18\sb120 You may want to hide {\b PumpKIN} window and leave it as a tray icon only. Just click the \{bmct pumpkin.bmp\} icon in the tray or simply close the window.
\par\sa120\sb120\qj\pard \f1\fs18\sb120 Use {\uldb Options}{\v Options} button to set {\b PumpKIN} options.
\par\sa120\sb120\qj\pard \f1\fs18\sb120 You can start and stop {\b PumpKIN}'s {\i TFTP} server by checking and unchecking the {\b Server is running} checkbox in the lower right corner of main {\b PumpKIN} window.

${\footnote Confirm Read Request Dialog}
{ \f1\fs18\b\sb120 Confirm Read Request Dialog}
\par\sa120\sb120\qj\pard \f1\fs18\sb120 When the file is requested from your {\i TFTP} server you may choose to {\b Grant Access} to this file or to {\b Deny Access}. If you hesitate to answer for {\uldb {\b Confirmation timeout}}{\v ConfirmationTimeout} ({\i default - 30 seconds}) {\b PumpKIN} defaults to denial of all requests.

#{\footnote ConfirmWRQ}
${\footnote Confirm Write Request Dialog}
{ \f1\fs18\b\sb120 Confirm Write Request Dialog}
\par\sa120\sb120\qj\pard \f1\fs18\sb120 Whenever your party sends you a file you have always a choice to accept it or not. You can also save the file under a different name by choosing the {\b Rename} option. If you already have file with such name you may chose to {\b resume} transfer. No checking on file contents is done. This option may or may not work depending on remote implementation of protocol. It does work if you use {\b PumpKIN} on both ends. If you are still unsure for {\uldb {\b Confirmation timeout}}{\v ConfirmationTimeOut} ({\i default - 30 seconds}) {\b PumpKIN} will make safe decision for you (deny).

#{\footnote Request}
${\footnote Request Dialog}
{ \f1\fs18\b\sb120 Request Dialog}
\par\sa120\sb120\qj\pard \f1\fs18\sb120 Request dialog is aimed to let you form read or write request. You may set the following options:\pard
\par \fi0\li0 \bullet   {\b Local File} - You can change the name of the file you're sending (or destination in case you're receiving) right here. You may also use {\b Browse} button to select the file.
\par \fi0\li0 \bullet   {\b Remote File} Specifies the name of file on the remote host you're requesting (in case of read request) or the name of file you want your file to appear as (in case of write request).
\par \fi0\li0 \bullet   {\b Remote Host} is your party's host or {\i TFTP} server you're requesting file from/sending file to. To refresh the list of your talk windows use {\b REFRESH} button.
\par \fi0\li0 \bullet   {\b Type} is the type of transfer as defined in {\uldb {\b RFC1350}}{\v %!ExecFile("http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1350.txt")}. Doesn't mean much, really. Defined types are '{\i octet}' or '{\i netascii}'. Default is '{\i octet}'.
\par \fi0\li0 \bullet   {\b Block Size} - Use this block size if remote is {\uldb {\b RFC1783}}{\v %!ExecFile("http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1783.txt")}-compliant. If remote doesn't support this option {\b PumpKIN} will fallback to 512 bytes per block.\pard

{ \f1\fs18\b\sb120 Network Options}\pard
\par \fi0\li0 \bullet   {\b UDP Ports}\pard
\par \fi0\li0 \bullet   {\b Listen for incoming connections on port} - specifies the port we're listening to. The default as defined in {\uldb {\b RFC1350}}{\v %!ExecFile("http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1350.txt")} is 69.
\par \fi0\li0 \bullet   {\b Send outgoing requests to port} - specifies the port we're going to send all requests to.\pard
\par \fi0\li0 \bullet   {\b Default Connection timeout} - if there's no activity for specified time, transfer is considered to be dead and terminated. {\b PumpKIN} tries to propagate this value to remote as described in {\uldb {\b RFC1782}}{\v %!ExecFile("http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1782.txt")} and {\uldb {\b RFC1784}}{\v %!ExecFile("http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1784.txt")} if possible.
\par \fi0\li0 \bullet   {\b Default Block Size} - {\b PumpKIN} tries to negotiate block size with remote using this value unless specified explicitly in request. If remote doesn't support {\uldb {\b RFC1782}}{\v %!ExecFile("http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1782.txt")} and {\uldb {\b RFC1783}}{\v %!ExecFile("http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1783.txt")}{\b PumpKIN} falls back to 512 bytes per block.\pard

{ \f1\fs18\b\sb120 Server Options}\pard
\par \fi0\li0 \bullet   {\b TFTP Filesystem root} - Specifies the location of files you're transmitting or where to start looking for them from. Defaults to the directory you start {\b PumpKIN} for the first time from.
\par \fi0\li0 \bullet   {\b Allow access to subdirectories} - specifies whether you want allow access to the whole subtree of {\b TFTP Root} or only to the directory itself.
\par \fi0\li0 \bullet   {\b Read Request Behavior} - You may choose to automatically agree to give all files requested, to be prompted to confirm these operations, or to deny all requests as if you're not even here.
\par \fi0\li0 \bullet   {\b Write Request Behavior} - You may chose to {\b take all files} ({\i not recommended}), to {\b prompt only if file exists already}, {\b Always prompt} or {\b Deny all requests}.
\par \fi0\li0 \bullet   {#{\footnote ConfirmationTimeOut}}{\b Confirmation timeout} - this is the time {\b PumpKIN} will wait for you to accept or deny request before it will give up and take default action which is always deny.
\par \fi0\li0 \bullet   {\b Log file} - If you want to enable logging to file, set the destination file here.\pard

\par\sa120\sb120\qj\pard \f1\fs18\sb120 The rule consists of {\b request type}, source network ({\b ip} and {\b netmask}) and {\b action} to take (see also {\uldb Server Options}{\v ServerOptions}).
\par\sa120\sb120\qj\pard \f1\fs18\sb120 When {\b PumpKIN} receives request it goes through the list of rules and bases its decision on the first matching rule. To rearrange order of rules, select the rule you wish to move and use up and down arrows buttons on the right. To remove rule, use the cross button.
\par\sa120\sb120\qj\pard \f1\fs18\sb120 To add a new rule fill in the information about {\b request type}, source {\b address} and {\b netmask} and desired action. Then click on the 'Add new rule' button.
